## General info

    Main purpose of this project is to put my knowledge of React to the test and attempt to build a [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) site that calls the Twitch API to grab and then display the information back to the user.

    The structure of the site is very basic and can be improved alot but the main functions I wanted to showcase were the following; responsive and fluid website design, working API calls using the async feature of React, and working Boostrap as the backbone for all the styling.

## Data Resources

- [React Main Page](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- [Twitch API Documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/)
- [OAuth 2.0 Documentation](https://oauth.net/getting-started/)
- [Axios Repository](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Surge Deployment Documentation](https://surge.sh/)

## Roadmap

    In the future I want to flesh out the design to make it more appealing and introduce new features such as embedded videos to watch without doing any external linking, add different categories to search/filter by, and adding the chat from their respective streams so you can see in real time what people are saying.
